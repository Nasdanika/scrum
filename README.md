# Nasdanika Scrum

This repository features:

* A model of Scrum concepts and their relationships.
* A model editor.
* TODO - A web application to collaboratively work on the model.

The goal of this repository is to provide tooling for Product Owners working on multiple products built for internal clients in a distributed environment.
The purpose of the model is two-fold:

* Capture relationships between different elements, e.g. which internal customers want a particular feature.
* Communicate the captured knowledge to the stakeholders.
